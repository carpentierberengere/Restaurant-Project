# Group Project - Restaurant Webpage

This project was made by **Simon Doneux**, **Thomas Bour**, **Ayoube El Yazizi** & **Bérengère Carpentier**(add github links).

Began the **7th** of December; deadline the **9th** of December.

## What was asked ? 

During this long and rather annoying pandemic, restaurants have it the worst. Forced to close, some of them find troubles in keeping their head out of the water, and fear bankruptcy. But in our times, there is a magical yet also practical thing that has been used for restaurants and consummers for a little while now : home deliveries (all hail deliveroo/ubereats).

## What did we do ?

As a team, we needed to create a webpage for a restaurant for it to be able to take orders from clients and deliver it to them.

We needed to include a presentation page, a menu page (to look and browse through the different dishes) and an open/closed time board. 

## What did we use ? 

* Javascript 
* HTML
* CSS 
* Framework 

# What does it look like ?
