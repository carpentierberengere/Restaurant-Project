# :sushi: Group Project - Webpage NIGIRI HOUSE :sushi:

This project was made by [**Simon Doneux**](https://github.com/doneuxsimon), [**Thomas Bour**](https://github.com/ThomasBour), [**Ayoube El Yazizi**](https://github.com/ayoubelyazizi) & [**Bérengère Carpentier**](https://github.com/carpentierberengere).

Began the **7th** of December; deadline the **9th** of December.

## What was asked ? 

During this long and rather annoying pandemic, restaurants have it the worst. Forced to close, some of them find troubles in keeping their head out of the water, and fear bankruptcy. But in our times, there is a magical yet also practical thing that has been used by restaurants and consumers for a little while now : home deliveries (all hail deliveroo/ubereats/takeaway).

## What did we do ?

As a team, we needed to create a webpage for a restaurant for it to be able to take orders from clients and deliver it to them.

We needed to include a presentation page, a menu page (to look and browse through the different dishes) and an open/closed time board. 

Using what we had learned about DOM, RegEx and other JS codes, we needed to create a "functionning site", where mock clients could send contact forms, put dishes in their card and visualize the potential open service hours on the open/closed page.

## What did we use ? 

* Javascript 
* HTML
* CSS 
* Framework (**BULMA**)
